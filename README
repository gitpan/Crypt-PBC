    my $pairing = new Crypt::PBC("params_d.txt");
    my $G1      = $pairing->init_G1->random;
    my $G2      = $pairing->init_G2->random->double->square;

"Chapter 1. Overview"

The following text is the Overview chapter from the PBC library
documentation:

    The PBC library is a free portable C library designed to make it
    easy to implement pairing-based cryptosystems. It provides an
    abstract interface to a cyclic group with a bilinear pairing, and
    the programmer does not need to worry about, or even know about
    elliptic curves.

    It is built on top of GMP, another C library which performs
    arbitrary precision arithmetic on integers, rationals and floats
    with strong emphasis on portability and speed.
