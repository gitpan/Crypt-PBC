0.4.2-0.7.17:  Sat Dec  2 09:21:55 EST 2006
   - This is a documentation fix only.
   - There will be a new version very soon though.  I need to make serious
     changes to the argument type restrictions as they should apparently not be
     the same on different types of curves (symmetric vs asymmetric curves).

0.4.2-0.7.16:  Fri Dec  1 09:20:30 EST 2006
   - jettero made more synonyms for pairing_apply because of frequent typos
   - jettero fixed several documenation typos

0.4.2-0.7.15:  Tue Nov 28 10:16:07 EST 2006
   - jettero reversioned the package in preparation for launch.

0.4.1-0.5.04:  Tue Nov 28 10:13:55 EST 2006
   - jettero added the slamtest, which slams functions with all the wrong
     arguments, literally, in the permutation sense.  It ran all night.
     The test in the shipped-package is _much_ shorter, but can be extended
     with 'MAX_PERM_TIME=1000 make test'

0.4.1-0.5.03:  Sun Nov 26 22:26:33 EST 2006
   - jettero added a memory (leak) test

0.4.1-0.5.02:  Sun Nov 26 21:52:00 EST 2006
   - jettero added a couple more tests and boatloads of docs

0.3.17-0.5.01:  Mon Nov 20 08:38:04 EST 2006
   - jettero completed a few more t/ tests (this time for the earith.xs).

0.3.17-0.5.00:  Thu Nov 16 20:03:34 EST 2006
   - jettero reversioned the package to represent the version of libpbc it
     is intended to work with in addition to the version of the perl API.
     0.3.17-0.5.00 means PBC.pm version 0.5.00 intended to work with libpbc
     0.3.17.

0.10:  Tue Nov 14 07:12:55 EST 2006
   - jettero added a bit of type-saftey to PBC.pm. It seems libpbc
     segfaults when the LHS and BASE of pow_zn() aren't in the same group,
     or when pairing_apply() is applied on arguments that aren't
     GT=e_hat(G1, G2); and that took some figurin'.

0.09:  Sun Nov 12 15:13:33 EST 2006
   - jettero started using element2bytes instead of element2mpz to print
     elements. Many of the elements are atually quadratics, and poly coeffs
     and the PBC crew do not make it simple to get to the mpzs.

0.08:  Sun Nov 12 11:23:48 EST 2006
   - jettero noticed possible bugs in either the init or as_str of
     elements...

0.07:  Sun Nov 12 09:03:27 EST 2006
   - jettero fixed my changelog app

0.01  Fri Nov 10 23:07:15 2006
    - I got this package all skeled up ...  I need a small part of it for a
      school project so I'm going to focus on that part first.
